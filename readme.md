## Description

In this repository, you will find a collection of exercises in C that I completed during my time at university. These exercises cover various topics and concepts in C programming.

## Getting Started

To get started with these exercises, you will need a C compiler installed on your machine. If you don't have one, you can download and install [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org/).

## Usage

Each exercise is organized in its own directory and contains the necessary source code files. You can navigate to the exercise directory and compile the source code using the following command:

gcc <source_file.c> -o <output_file>
